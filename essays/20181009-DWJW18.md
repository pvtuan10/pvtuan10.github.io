One month ago, I was invited to attend [Jenkins World 2018](https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco) conference in San Francisco. For a young fresh graduate like me, it was a very great experience.

I was going to SF is to present what I did 2 months ago during [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins). My project is [Remoting Kafka Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin) and I did my presentation about my projet during Jenkins Contributor Summit at the event. I am going to have a summary about my trip in this post and if you are still reading, it will be a long post ahead ^^

# Day 1: Travel day

I flew from Singapore to San Francisco on Saturday with Cathay Pacific and transit in Hong Kong. The flight was delayed 1.5 hours in Singapore and I was quite rushed with the transit, not very sure why I don't book the direct flight in the first place T_T. However, I still safely arrived to SF and this is what SF looked like when I arrived there.

During evening, I had a chance to meet and had dinner with [Oleg](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev), my mentor during GSoC. Oleg helped me a lot with the project during summer and finally we had a chance to meet in person, not by Google Hangout call. This is the picture that we took together during the day of conference.

# Day 2: Free day

I got a Sunday free before the conference and I spent most of the time to recover and go shopping to buy some gifts for my family and friends. Because I visited SF last year already, there is no tourist place that interests me this time. I also had a chance to meet [Martin](https://github.com/martinda) in person. He is also another GSoC mentor, but I did not work directly with him. This was a good day to rest before the next 5 days of conference and hackathon.

# Day 3: Jenkins World Day 1
